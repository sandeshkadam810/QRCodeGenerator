# Django SaaS Boilerplate (production ready)
Focus on building your core functionality, skip writing repetitive code. Comes packed with landing page, Payment integration, blog, User model, sitemap and more.

### Why use Django SaaS boilerplate?
Using a Django saas boilerplate can save you a lot of time, which is a huge benefit. Most customers don't care if you start from scratch or use a template; they just want their problem solved quickly. Whether you use Django or another framework usually doesn't matter to them as long as the job gets done efficiently.

This boilerplate can help you save hours of work, allowing you to focus on core functionality of your  SaaS instead of spending a lot of time on setting up stripe, blog, login functionalities and landing page.

## Customizing

All html, css, js and assets lies inside the templates.
- To modify the landing page, update `home.html`.
- To add link to header and footer or modify head tags, check `base.html`.
- extend `base.html` to have the same footer and header.

### Adding title, description to page
To add title and meta tags to a page use the following tags
```py
{% block title %}lorem impsum {% endblock title %}
{% block description %}lorem impsum{% endblock description %} #meta description

{% block socialTitle %}{{blog.title}} | {% endblock socialTitle %} # open graph title, for socials
{% block socialDescription %}{{blog.meta_description}}{% endblock socialDescription %} # open graph description, for socials
{% block pageType %}article{% endblock pageType %}

```
To add scripts at the end of the elements
```
{% block scripts %}
    <script src="{% static "" %}" />
{% endblock scripts %}
```

### Payment - Stripe
By default it is set up to use Stripe you can however change this to use other 
payment gateways supported by django-payments. 

> [!CAUTION]  
> Don't make payment to your self in production, as this goes against Stripe terms of use. Use only stripe test account for testing purposes.

You can get the stripe test account secret key, public key and webhook key from stripe dashboard.

* To forward webhook request to local development follow the stripe guide: https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks#local-listener

## Deployment:

You can make use of Railway to deploy your own instance. 

<a href="https://railway.app?referralCode=BfMDHP">
  <img src="railway.png" alt="railway icon" height="50px"/>
</a>

Link to deploy to [Railway.app](https://railway.app?referralCode=BfMDHP)

once you complete make sure to 
```
python manage.py collectstatic
```
and set
```
DEBUG=0
```
**Generate secret key**
To generate secret key use `from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key` then `get_random_secret_key()` in your python shell

**Note:** Don't forget to set the sites to your domain instead of example.com in the admin panel

> [!NOTE]  
> Make sure to add webhook endpoint during production via stripe, other wise you may not get the confirmations

### Create a firebase credential file

> [!NOTE] 
We'll be using firebase for persistent storage, to upload user files. Firebase is pre-configured as there are other firebase services developers may want to use. <br><br> You can also use any of the storage supported by [django-storages](https://github.com/jschneier/django-storages), if you don't want to use firebase.

To use Firebase

1. We use Google storage for storing files. Go to firebase -> storage -> create (make it public)

2. Now Go to firebase -> project settings -> service account -> Generate new private key.

Rename the private as `firebase-cred.json`

Use this private file as your credential file.

#### Deploying credential file to production
Sometimes your cloud provider may not provide you with storage for secret files. 
So convert the credential file to base64 using
```
base64 firebase-cred.json > encoded.txt
```
Now copy the contents of encoded.txt and paste it in `FIREBASE_ENCODED="wedde"` variable
